/**
 * Mark up a class to be a singleton i.e instantiated only once.
 *
 * Note that in order for this contract to actually be fulfilled, any (all) instantiation of said class must be done through {@link com.kissthinker.factory.Factory#instantiate(Class, Object...)}.
 * By instantiating classes (any including ones marked up as {@link Singleton}) this way, {@link com.kissthinker.factory.Factory} acts as a manager similar to a "container" managing object lifecycles.
 * If a class marked up {@link Singleton} is instantiated with "new", then this annotation is ignored and so the object will not be managed as a singleton.
